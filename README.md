# Flask + HTML Practice

## About Flask

Flask is a highly used Python micro Web Framework. It provides basic functionality to build web applications, like routing, request/response handling, etc. It's a "small" framework compared to other ones (like Django), but in many cases that's a great advantage.


## Install Instructions
Fork this repo and create a new cloud9 workspace as we do with other projects. Then follow the usual steps:

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv flask-html-practice -p /usr/bin/python3
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the app server

Flask framework provides, out of the box, a way to run a development web server in your local machine. Just execute the `run_app.py` script available in the project and the application will stay listening at `localhost:8080`. (Make sure to have all the requirements previously installed)

```bash
$ python run_app.py
```


## Running tests

Tests are split among several functions. You can run them all together doing `pytest tests.py` or select individual based on keyword expressions like `pytest -k 'test_1' tests.py`.


## Tasks

The goal for this practice is to implement a simple login form with username and password, introducing some HTML content and some extra Flask functionalities apart from the ones used in the last practice (i.e: redirect, abort, etc)

The first three views are done for you as an example. You'll have to reply the same given functionality but in a single view combining actions for both GET and POST methods.

You'll work on `login_form()` view. You'll have to somehow determine which HTTP method was used (either GET or POST).
  - If GET method was used, just return HTML content with the login form. Make sure that the new HTML login form points to the same /login-form URL while POSTing
  - If POST method was used, get the given username and password from the form data and perform a redirect to `index()` view sending the username as payload.
    NOTE: If any of username or password were not given, use Flask's `abort()` function to return a 404 - Not found response

#### Extra task:

For this task, you'll have to create a user profile using the given data. In order to do that, take a look at the `profile.html` file located inside a folder called `templates` (in which Flask looks for templates by default). Some of the user data was completed for you as an example, but you have to complete the rest of it.

Once the HTML code is completed, render it using the `render_template()` function imported from Flask, and send the user data as context.
